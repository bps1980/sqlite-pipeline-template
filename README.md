# SQLite Pipeline Template (Demo)

This repository contains a safe, minimal template for building a stateful pipeline using SQLite.  
It demonstrates how to structure:

- a simple schema
- a pipeline processor
- a state machine for transitions
- a clean, modular folder layout

This is a **demo only** — no production logic, schemas, or internal business rules are included.

## 📚 Contents

### demo/
- schema.sql — placeholder schema for leads + messages
- pipeline.py — example pipeline processor
- state_machine.py — simple state transition logic

### diagrams/
- pipeline_flow.png — conceptual diagram of the pipeline flow

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo demonstrates:
- how to structure a stateful pipeline
- how to model transitions cleanly
- how to separate schema, pipeline logic, and state logic
- how to build internal tools using SQLite as a lightweight engine

It is designed to attract:
- backend engineering work
- automation consulting
- internal tooling projects
- workflow/pipeline architecture gigs

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository contains **no production code** from any internal system.  
It is a conceptual mock for demonstration and portfolio purposes only.
